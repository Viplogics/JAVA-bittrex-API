# JAVA-bittrex-API
Java-Client for the Bittrex REST-API


Bittrex is a US-based leading trading platform for crypto-currencies created by security professionals. 

It provides a simple and powerful REST API to allow programatically to perform nearly all actions that can be done via  the bittrex web-interface. All requests use the application/json content type and go over https. The base url is https://bittrex.com/api/{version}/.

There was no JAVA-client library yet, so I have written this one.

Use at your own risk...!

Tips are appreciated:
